Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Machine Learning, SVM

Built a predictive machine learning model to identify the likelihood of heart disease using patient health metrics (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate). Utilized the UCI Heart Disease dataset and applied preprocessing techniques such as missing value handling, normalization, and feature selection. Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Achieved over 90% accuracy using Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Visualized key performance metrics including confusion matrix curve for model validation.
